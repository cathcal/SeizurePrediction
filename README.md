MATLAB:

Notes: 

- The Wavelet Toolbox and the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox are needed in order to run this program

- The program was not designed to check errors for incorrect user inputs. If an invalid value is typed in, the program will fail and exit

1) Download the data from: https://www.kaggle.com/c/melbourne-university-seizure-prediction/data
2) Load the data, EEG_SVM.m, eeg_read_svm.m, feature_matrix.m into the current path for MATLAB
3) Run EEG_SVM:
  A) Type the patient number (1, 2 or 3)
  B) Type the number of trials to run (minimum number: 2)
  C) Type 1 for Training, 2 for Testing *A training trial MUST be run before a testing trial, otherwise an error will occur and the program will fail
4) Define the weboptions:
  myOptions = weboptions(‘ContentType’, ‘json', ‘MediaType', 'application/json', ‘RequestMethod', 'post', ‘ArrayFormat’, ‘json');
5) Type: 
  response = webwrite('https://seizureprediciton.firebaseio.com/FILELABEL.json', TestLabel, myOptions);
  
  *Note: restrict the amount of data that is uploaded to approximately 100 samples, since the website has difficulty displaying too much data and will become unresponsive
